# RHme3
It was August 2017 and a friend talked me about a challenge created by [Riscure](https://www.riscure.com/), it was the [RHme3](https://rhme.riscure.com/3/news) qualifications. I was searching some fun and this caught my attention, besides, I could win a Arduino-compatible board.

I spent some funny time and I could resolve the 3 challenges :smiley:

At this time I still thought I couldn't resolve many challenges of the main stage. But 5 months later, when main challenges were published and I checked them, I was happy because I saw that I could have opportunity of resolve several challenges.

After three months playing with the challenges in my free time, I could resolve 14 challenges (all except SCA and FI), I won some medals and finally I was 5th!
