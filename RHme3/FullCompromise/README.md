# Full Compromise
An attacker managed to hack our CI server and sign+encrypt his malicious code in a ECU firmware, that is now running in millions of cars and doing Chaos knows what. To stop the attackers, we must know what the malicious code is doing. We have a history of all binaries signed by the server on the day of the hack, and a device running the attacker's firmware. Help us find which sample was provided by the attacker and get access to its management interface.
