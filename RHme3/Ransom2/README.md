# Ransom 2.0
In theory, this firmware mod was supposed to give you 30% extra horsepower and torque. In reality, it's something different. For real this time.

## Write-up
This challenge seems like Ransom. It should have some bug fixed but I didn't use a bug to resolve Ransom :confused:, let's try...

1. We run the challenge and we have the same user ID of Ransom.

2. We test the same unlock code obtained in Ransom and get the flag!!
```
Your car is taken hostage by REVENANTTOAD ransomware version DEBUG_a4fae86c.
To get your car back, send your user ID:
3835320707001500

and $1337 to the following rhme3coin address: 
[CENSORED].

Already paid? Then enter the received unlock code here:
267EDED9BE5402DA79E745ABEEDEBD14
It was a pleasure doing business with you.
Your car is now unlocked.
Here is a bonus:

Have a nice day!
